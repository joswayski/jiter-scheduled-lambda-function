# Schedule a Lambda Function with Jiter

#### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have installed `typescript` and the `aws-cdk` globally. You can find instructions for the AWS CDK [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html)

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
